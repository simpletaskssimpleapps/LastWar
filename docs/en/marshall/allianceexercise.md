## Marshall Event Instructions for R4-5

### Setting up Alliance Exercise

1. Move the alliance teleport marker to the location where you want the Marshall to spawn.
2. Open Events, Marshall, and select the appropriate level and time. For example, we select Level 5, 21:30 for our current 2 hours and 2 mins schedule.
3. Click build. The game will build the Marshall at the alliance teleport marker location. If that is occupied, the game will build the Marshall at the nearest available location (Not preferred)
4. IMPORTANT: Once the Marshall is placed, Move the alliance teleport marker somewhere else, so that once we kill it, people don't teleport to the Marshall's spot accidentally.

### Wrenches

1. Add a random marker saying to "Donate Wrenches".
2. Once Marshall is maxxed out, change marker from previous step to say "DO NOT Donate Wrenches".

### During Alliance Exercise

R4-5s have a 2.5% to 5% boost in damage in their own rallies. Please be available during event. If you cannot, let R5 know to rotate someone in for the event. Ideally, all 9 R4-5s should start 1 rally.

## Marshall Event Instructions for Strongest Players

If you easily score the individual point requirements, and alliance score is also consistently reaching tier 5, I recommend starting your rallies 1 to 2 mins after everyone else.

## Marshall Event Instructions for everyone

Each Marshall tier has the following 3 objectives, sorted by priority:

- Reach the alliance target. Nothing else is more important.
- Ensure 1 player reaches the minimum threshold for MVP x10 multiplier.
- Ensure maximum players reach the individual target.
