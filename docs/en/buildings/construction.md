# Buildings and Construction

Construction in MMO strategy games like Last War follow one the following strategies. I recommend starting as playing tall, and switching to balanced at each temporary plateau.

- **Playing Tall**: Playing tall in strategy games refers to the concept of focused, high paced growth. In this game, it refers to attempting to get to the next troop tier, ignoring less important buildings. I personally recommend this approach in early game as changes in troop tiers in these games are absolutely insane. Furthermore, as you progress, the previously ignored buildings become extremely easy to upgrade.
- **Completionism**: Completionism in strategy games refers to the concept of completely level up all buildings to your current level before upgrading to the next. While this approach provides a stronger foundation, very few completionists ever reach the end game.
- **Balanced Tall and Wide**: Another of my recommendations. Once you reach a temporary plateau while playing tall (considering that each level is progressively costlier and lengthier to get to), especialy near late game, you can start balancing out the levels of the buildings you ignored while getting here. I recommend balancing out at each troop tier level (such as 17, 20, 24, 27 etc).
- **Random**: Upgrading randomly, or game suggested buildings is second the most inefficient way to play this game (quitting being the most inefficient).

## What to Level Next

The following image outlines the buildings and their applicable levels you need for progressing to each level. For example, if you are currently at HQ 22 and going for 23, you can see requirements for HQ23 in game. However, with this image, you can see that you can start improving alliance center, so that it is faster from HQ23 to HQ24.
